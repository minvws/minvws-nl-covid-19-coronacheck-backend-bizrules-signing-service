"""
Currently, if events are provided with isSpecimen: true, you get back completely valid non-specimen domestic and
European credentials â€“ for the acceptance environment anyway. This is not desirable, as specimen events are for
testing purposes, and should not lead to usable credentials.

Instead:
    For domestic credentials the isSpecimen attribute should be set to "1"
    For European credentials the expirationTime should be set to the magic value 42. In this way, other countries
    will see the credential as expired, and the Dutch app can add logic so it is treated as specimen.

When the events that are provided don't all have the same value of isSpecimen (i.e. half of them is specimen, and half
of them is non-specimen), all specimen events should be discarded before continuing to issue credentials.

Not using datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(42) as that seems to return a timezone naive datetime.
